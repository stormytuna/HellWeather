# Hell Weather

Hell Weather adds a new weather type that is a combination of all weather types. Hell weather will only activate weathers that can naturally occur on that map, no foggy Assurance or flooded Titan, etc.

This will probably not work with any other modded weathers.

Configs for:

- Whether or not to apply each weather type
- Whether or not each level will always have the Hell weather active
